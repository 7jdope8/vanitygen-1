This is a fork from OpenCL version of the Bitcoin vanity address generator that is adapted to use for the 32btc bounty.

These are the change from the original vanity generator:

- Replace Random Number Generation of Private Key with Sequental Decrementing Mode, starting key is set with command line arguments
- Periodically dump progress (current private key) to a file
- Now oclvanitygen generates only compressed addresses from private key, add support for generation of uncompressed addresses
- Replace current feature of "read prefixes from file" to "read full addresses from file" (thousands of addresses)
- Store addresses (to find) in search efficient O(1) structure like hashset
- Remove saving hashes to the GPU's memory; check the addresses immediately

Usage:

make oclvanitygen

./oclvanitygen -f addresses.txt -o found.txt -k lastkey.txt 5KHon4xmV31t9dFSHzeN3KF3R1EvjnSRCuy5ZcVEL83NZXzsyeE

An argument if the starting private key.
